    - [ ] For the slides on _“An Introduction to Hadron Spectroscopy from Lattice QCD”_, read each section, take notes, and create a reduced PDF by removing transition slides. 
        - [ ] The Hadron Spectrum.
        - [ ] Lattice QCD Spectroscopy.
        - [ ] Finite-volume effects: stable particles.
        - [ ] Scattering processes and resonances.
